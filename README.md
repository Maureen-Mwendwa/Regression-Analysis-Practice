# Regression Analysis Practice

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates regression analysis techniques applied to a bike-sharing dataset. The project is a hands-on practice following the **Microsoft Learn Module**.

## Objectives
- Perform regression analysis using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), LASSO, RIDGE, and Decision Trees.
- Explore data cleaning methods and outlier detection techniques.
- Build predictive models and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset
The dataset, `daily-bike-share.csv`, contains features related to bike rentals, weather, and seasonality.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Detect and analyze outliers using boxplots and the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualize relationships between features and the target variable (`rentals`).

3. **Regression Models**
   - OLS Regression
   - LASSO Regression
   - RIDGE Regression
   - Decision Tree Regression

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compare models using metrics like RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

This practice was inspired by the **Microsoft Learn Regression Module**, which provides excellent resources for understanding regression analysis.
